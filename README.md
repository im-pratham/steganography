<p>In this today's digital world, humans are more concerned about the privacy of data. The most coomon method used for making the data private is encryption, where the data is converted into some unreadable format using some algorithms. The difference between steganography and cryptography is that in cryptography, one can tell that a message has been encrypted, but he cannot decode the message without knowing the proper key. In steganography, the message itself may not be difficult to decode, but most people would not detect the presence of the message.
<p>Steganography comes from the Greek word meaning covered writing. Steganography is process of hiding a message within another so that the presence of the hidden message is hard to detect. The key concept behind steganography is that the message to be transmitted is not detectable to the casual eye. In fact, people who the are not intended to be the recipients of the message should not even suspect that a hidden message exists.
<p>In this project, I have created a simple Steganography software which is written in 'C' and 'NCURSES'. To run this project, download the attached files and change your current directory to extracted folder and type :
<br><code>$ make </code>
<br><code>$ ./project </code>
